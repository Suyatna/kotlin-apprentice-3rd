/*
Challenge 2.
Create a version of the Student class that uses a factory method loadStudent(studentMap: Map<String, String>)
to create a student with a first and last name from a map such as mapOf("first_name" to "Neils", "last_name" to "Bohr").
Default to using “First” and “Last” as the names if the map not contain a first name or last name.
